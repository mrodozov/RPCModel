1. create setters for DataObject
2. Write more subroutines for dealing with root files
3. Write such a method and container for a roll , where single roll have a mechanism to store in itself rate and other info for morethan one run. good
solution is to create RollInterface type pointer which is allocated dynamically as array of objects with the same type as the object holder itself  ,
by method to which we pass the dimensions of the array (COOL , - each of those elements could also allocate their own containers ) 
4. Write DataObject container to depend not on dynamically allocated strings but a 
map <string,string*> where the argument numberOfElements passed to the constructor determines the dimension of the strip pointer
like 
string * currentString = new string[numberOfElements-1] ; 
because the first element in the file will be used as the key. This way , the dwo dimensional maps could be very easily handled - 
we are not using for each element search in the map , but we could use the method find of the map ....  
5. Write an method to plot Ecap vs Phi -> Done
6. Write an method to plot Barrel-Ecap - online parts , using the text files (database.txt) and the info about dead masked  -> Done
7. -> the idea is to get rid of all the macros sed to plot whatever :)  -> Done
8. Try to ask somebody how to fetch the lumi data from the db in order to upload this rate vs lumi on the web -> No way so far
